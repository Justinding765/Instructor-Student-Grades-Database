# Instructor/Student Grading Web Application
* An Instructor-Student-Grades-Database written using HTML/CSS/Javascript for the Front end, and Python Flask framework and SQL for the back end
* Developed a website that supports account creation, login, and logout features. It allows users to create accounts as
either an instructor or a student with differing features for either. Integrated special features where instructors would get access to all the students’ grades, and have the ability to add or edit marks. Students would only be able to view their own grades and provide feedback to a selected instructor
* Must have python flask installed (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/)
* Must have SQLite installed (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
* Run using the app.py on an IDE that supports Python Flask
